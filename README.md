## Introduction

Everybody likes music, right? Odds are, if you do, you have heard of **Spotify**.

In this lab, we will be building a simplified version of the Spotify landing page:

Let's do this!

### Iteration 1: Navbar

- The navbar should be `position: fixed`.
- Align the logo to the left and the `ul` with the links to the right, either using `float` or `flex`.

### Iteration 2: Large image background with text

- Check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on centering things.

### Iteration 3: What is on Spotify section

- It looks like the `div`s take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?

### Iteration 4: The green section

- It looks like we have 2 main sections, a containing element with the text flowing from top to bottom, and the image of the Spotify player on the right.
- Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the _green_ `div`.
